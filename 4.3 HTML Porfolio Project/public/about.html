<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I'm a student currently on a journey to upskill myself and dive into the world of web development. As I explore and learn new skills, I'm eager to grow both personally and professionally. This website will serve as a showcase for all my projects, and although I'm just getting started, I’m excited about the progress I will make.

  Right now, I'm a beginner, but I'm committed to improving every day. In the coming months, I hope to be able to show you the results of my hard work and share everything I’ve learned so far. Thanks for visiting, and I can’t wait to take you along on this journey of growth and discovery!</p>
